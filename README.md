# current-weather-at-location
This script prompts the user for an OpenWeatherMap API key and a location, and then uses the requests library to make an API call to OpenWeatherMap to retrieve the current weather conditions for the location. The weather conditions are then printed to the console.

To use this script, you will need to install the requests library by running the following command:

    pip install requests

You will also need to sign up for a free API key from OpenWeatherMap. You can do this by going to the following URL: https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up
